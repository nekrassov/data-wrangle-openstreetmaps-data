For this project I chose to analyze St Petersburg, Russia area,
where I was born:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/saint-petersburg_russia.osm.bz2 


I mostly used MongoDB reference at this link:
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/

In sample.py I made a change to write every 100th element, not every 10th
because original code still produced large file (74 MB)

The Python scripts in P2.6 folder were used to solve Lesson 6 exercises;
scripts in root folder were used to complete the project on St Petersburg dataset
